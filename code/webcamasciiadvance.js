      Now it's time to show ASCII art on the screen. First, we set drawing

      ASCII Art library, that writes the contents of a two-dimensional array
      containing (implicitly) text characters (chars) on the screen. In this
      case, we call a function with 2 parameters: the first is the table
      whose contents we want to print, and the second is the destination (an
      object with "canvas" property). If you use the function with two
      parameters (as we do in this example), it will assume that you need to
      fill the entire surface of the target canvass with a drawing. However,
      the function can be called in 3 variants:
        [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst);
        [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst, _x, _y);
        [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst, _x, _y, _w, _h);
      The parameters are as follows:
        _arr2d - 2-dimentional array containing glyphs (chars)
        _dst - destination (typically the sketch itself)
        _x, _y - coordinates of the upper left corner
        _w, _h - width and height
      It is relatively easy to write your own function that formats the contents
      of an array to ASCII graphics. At the end of this example, I glue the
      function code from a non-minimized version of the library - it can be
      used as a base for your own experiments.

  A simple function to help us print the ASCII Art on the screen. The function
  prints a two-dimensional array of glyphs and it is used similarly to the

  that the width and height of the printed text block is equal to the width and
  height of the working space (that's mean: equal to the _dst size) and it
  starts drawing from upper left corner (coords: 0, 0). When using the version
  with 4 parameters, the function assumes that the width and height of the
  printed text block is equal to the width and height of the working space
  (that's mean: equal to the _dst size). _arr2d is the two-dimensional array of
  glyphs, _dst is destinetion (basically anything with 'canvas' property, such
